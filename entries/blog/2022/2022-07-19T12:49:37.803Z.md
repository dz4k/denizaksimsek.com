## Resource Expansion ##

    < GET https://example.com/users/john_doe
    > { "name": "John Doe", "friends": "/users/john_doe/friends" }
    
    < GET https://example.com/users/john_doe?expand=friends
    > { "name": "John Doe", "friends": { "joe_bloggs": "/users/joe_bloggs" } }

Substitute the link named `friends` with the resource at that link.


## Resource Traversal ##

    < DELETE https://example.com/users/john_doe?traverse=friends.joe_bloggs
    > { "msg": "Removed friend joe_bloggs" }

Server will internally GET each link up to the last, and respond with a 307
redirect to the last.
