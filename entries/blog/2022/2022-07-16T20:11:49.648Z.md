I found a heading syntax I like for lightweight markup.

There are three forms i know of:
 1. Leading marker, which is repeated for smaller heading levels
 2. rST style, freely choose between underline characters for each level
 3. Predetermined character for underlines

2 makes copy-pasting between documents hard. 3 requires memorizing more syntax (and 2 devolves into 3 on any large writing project). And 1...

I don't like Markdown headings. Smaller heading levels have more visually prominent markings, and the actual content of headings is indented which is very rarely how headings are presented.

Recently I came up with a heading syntax I actually like, though I don't know how others will find it:

Yes, it's just the Markdown style flipped around. Having hashes at the end of headings feels very natural to me after reading so many docs pages which use # for heading anchors. We still have the "big markings for small headings" issue. It doesn't bother me as much when the marker is at the end of a line, but I'd still like to find a solution.
