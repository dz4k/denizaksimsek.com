I made a tool to make bookmarklets in [_hyperscript](//hyperscript.org). You just write some code in the box and drag the bookmarklet into your bookmarks toolbar. Hypelet injects glue code to load hyperscript dynamically and run your code. You can get a permalink to share your bookmarklet.

- Here's Hypelet: [Hypelet](//hypelet.dz4k.com)
- Here's the code for a bookmarklet to get the RSS feed of a page: [Get RSS -- Hypelet][get-rss]

[get-rss]: https://hypelet.dz4k.com/#%7B%22hs%22%3A%22get%20the%20href%20of%20the%20first%20%3C%5Brel%3Dfeed%5D%2C%20%5Btype%5E%3D%5C%22application%2Frss%2Bxml%5C%22%5D%2F%3E%5Cncall%20alert(it)%22%2C%22name%22%3A%22get%20rss%20feed%22%7D
