this is a new programming language, right?
and the people who made it are also making a blockchain thing for it to run on.
which made some people, including me, sad.
so someone laments this, and someone else comes in:

> Which to me says theyâ€™re focusing on the decentralized application portion of blockchains instead of the scam coins.

now, i wasn't convinced.
because, i'm no expert but, a blockchain can't work without a currency, right?
it's part of the algorithmic foundation to have some token that the chain itself can reimburse participants with...

so how did they do this? did they finally invent a Good Blockchain?

website takes me to readme, "There is no native coin" ok but how? readme takes me to whitepaper:

> As for block rewards, the same principle holds. Tokens and applications can leave rewards that only the block miner can collect. For example, <mark>Kindelia's Genesis Token</mark>, a no-premine currency which will be deployed by the Kindelia Foundation on the first block, will include a method that mints coins once per block, following Bitcoin's emission curve. This serves as an incentive for miners that keep the network secure. In other words, Kindelia <mark>doesn't need a built-in token to have block rewards and miner fees</mark>. Instead, it flexibly allows users to pay fees in whatever tokens they want, and miners to collect block rewards from <mark>a constellation of user-deployed tokens, rather than a single official one</mark>.

**It's a marketing trick.**{.allcaps}
"No native coin" just means that the coin is pluggable.
