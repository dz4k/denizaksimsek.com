One area where htmx apps lag behind SPAs is interaction delay.
While htmx apps usually have a much improved initial load time,
the need for a server roundtrip for most interactions is a disadvantage.

For most apps, this doesn't matter, as they are all frontends to databases anyway.
Thus, there is always a request to the server;
the difference is whether the response is HTML or a proprietary JSON-based format that needs to be converted to HTML.

The latency issue is even less of a problem thanks to... let's call it Application on CDN (AoCDN).
The common term for this technology is <no-spoiler>"edge compute"</no-spoiler>,
which I refuse to say.

AoCDN is a service offered by some hosting and CDN providers.
It means that your code runs on several servers all across the world, close to the user.
