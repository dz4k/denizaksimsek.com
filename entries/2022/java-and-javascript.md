title: Similarities between Java and JavaScript
---

Java and JavaScript are a lot more similar than we give them credit for.

 * A much-maligned language.
 * Old, crufty APIs.
 * Nicer today than many people remember.
 * Complex build tools.
 * Frameworks and metaframeworks galore.
 * So, so much reflection.
 * A vast universe of libraries for everything.
 * Runs on very cursed places. (Java on SIM cards, JavaScript on spacecrafts)
 * How do I make this an executable?
 * Brilliant runtime.

The main difference:
Java programmers pretend they're using JavaScript,
and JavaScript programmers pretend they're using Java.
