    A post with two signs on it, one partially covering the other. The signs
    are colored red with a thin white strip, then a thick green strip at the
    bottom.
    The front one says:
    "KÖKNAR CADDESİ ↞↠, [on white strip] MEHMET AKİF MAHALLESİ, [on green
    strip] ÇEKMEKÖY (TN:40 )".
    The one behind says:
    "BİL..". SOKAĞI, [on white strip] MEHMET AKİF MAHALLESİ, [on green strip]
    ÇEKMEKÖY (TN:60 )"

I mentioned these signs in [my post about the ones in Ordu][ordu-street-sign] and said I'd post a picture if I ever went to İstanbul. I think I just wasted my wish.

[![<%= it.photo.alt %>](<%= it.photo.src %>)](<%= it.photo.src %>)

While I didn't get to explore İstanbul due to the pandemic, I had an opportunity to see one of these for myself, with the custom-made _Kent_{lang=tr} typeface and the district color codes (as you can see, I was in the lime green Çekmeköy district). When I saw one IRL, I realized that the letters are embossed --- this doesn't show through in photos.

Although these two signs are on a post, many were on the sides of buildings. I don't like this much as it makes them harder to find. At least they don't nail them to trees like in Samsun though.
