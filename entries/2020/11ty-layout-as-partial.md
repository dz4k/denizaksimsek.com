**Update 2021-02-08:** This article mentions things about my website that are no longer true. The technique explained, however, still works fine.

On this website, I have both a Notes page and pages for each individual note. I wanted to use the same template for both, but I ran into an issue: accessing frontmatter data.

In Eleventy, frontmatter data for the current page is merged into the [data cascade][] and made available on the template global scope, whereas collection items have a `data` property. This made it hard to write templates that work with both the `page` object and collection items.

## Solution

The solution to my problem was right there in the Eleventy docs, staring at me, its description phrased such that it couldn't possibly be of use to anyone.

> For completeness, a `getCollectionItem` filter is also included that fetches the current page from a collection.

With this filter, all my problems were solved. I prepended the following to my `note.njk` template (similarly for `post.njk`):

~~~liquid
{%set item = note | d(collections.note | getCollectionItem(page))%}
~~~

When using `note.njk` as a partial, the caller assigns the variable `note`. When using it as a layout, no such variable will exist and the default (`d()`) will be used.. The beauty of this configuration is that in both situations, `item` will be a collection item with a `data` property.

One caveat is that because I'm using this as a partial, I can't use frontmatter, and therefore can't set a layout for my layout (maybe I could use template data files...). Instead, I use Nunjucks' builtin [template inheritance][].

~~~liquid
{%if not note%}
{%extends "base.njk"%}
{%endif%}
...
{%block content%}
{%set item = note | d(collections.note | getCollectionItem(page))%}
...
{%endblock%}
