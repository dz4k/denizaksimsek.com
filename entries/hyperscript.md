\_hyperscript is a programming language, created by Carson Gross of [htmx], 
that took over my life.

[htmx]: https://htmx.org

Git dates the [first commit from me] into the project to 
<time>2021-02-17</time>, a little over a year. From that point on, my commit history features such gems as

 - [`842e9fe`] <q>add missing comment</q>
 - [`5de7622`] <q>try and fail to fix js parsing</q>
 - [`2d64def`] <q>make packaging work (final) (final) (1) (Copy).doc</q>
 - a sequence of 8 commits with the message <q>more docs work</q>

My outdated résumé lists my contributions as follows:

 - Developed new features for the _hyperscript programming language: Web Worker integration, inline JavaScript, reusable behaviors
 - Developed a debugger with graphical UI
 - Added syntax highlighting to a web-based code editor (demonstrated in my tool, Hypelet)
 - Worked on performance and code size optimizations
 - Wrote documentation
 - Redesigned _hyperscript project homepage
 - Wrote a weekly newsletter discussing community news, which served as a promotional tool
