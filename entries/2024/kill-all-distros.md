title: kill all distros
---

so insane to me that people advocate for distro packaging over flatpak

hmm yes i love being unable to use up-and-coming software thet nobody packages 

yet and making it harder for new distros to get off the ground 

vertical monopolies are good when open source i guess

the concept of software package management existing is a failure

one (1) software should be expressible as one thing
