title: Event Delegation in _hyperscript

<p>This is how you do it:

<pre class="language-hyperscript">
on click
	tell the closest <li/> to the target
		remove yourself
		-- do more stuff...
		-- "you" refers to the clicked list item
</pre>

<p>Or more concisely:

<pre class="language-hyperscript">
on click tell closest <li/> to target
	remove yourself
</pre>

<pre><code class="lang-hyperscript"
>on click tell closest &lt;li/> to target
	remove yourself
</code></pre>

<hr>

<p>I've seen some people use a pattern like this:

<pre class="language-jinja2">
&lt;ul>
	{% for item in items %}
		&lt;li _="on click remove me">{{ item }}</li>
	{% endfor %}
&lt;/ul>
</pre>

<p>This is convenient to write if you have a server-side templating system, but
has a few issues:

<ul>
<li>The code needs to be parsed N times where N is the number of items.
<li>The resulting HTML is bloated.
<li>If you add more items client-side, you need to repeat the code there.
</ul>

<p>The pattern for resolving this is called <dfn>event delegation</dfn>. Here's
how you might do it in JavaScript:

<pre class="language-javascript">
ul.addEventListener('click', e => {
	const li = e.target.closest('li')
	if (!li) return
	li.remove()
})
</pre>

<p>We add a single event listener to the enclosing list, which finds the item
that was clicked and manipulates it.

<p>In _hyperscript, the <code>tell</code> command allows us to manipulate an
element other  than <code>me</code> conveniently, by changing the implicit
target from <code>me</code> to <code>you</code>,  which refers to the "element
being told".
