title: Webmentions
---

Webmentions are a way for websites to interact. Most commonly, it's used for 
comments, likes etc. on the [IndieWeb]. It basically works like this:

 * person A has something on their website
 * person B puts something on their own website that mentions it
 * a webmention request is sent to a server person A's website specifies

Webmentions can be sent in many ways: automatically by the website's own
server, manually by person B, or by an external service like 
<https://webmention.app>.

They can also be received by external services, like <https://webmention.io>.
This is useful for static websites without a server to receive and store them.

If you don't have a website, you can send webmentions using 
<https://commentpara.de>.
