- > The IndieWeb is a people-focused alternative to the "corporate web". 

- > The IndieWeb is a community of individual personal websites, connected by 
  > simple standards, based on the principles of owning your domain, using it as
  > your primary identity, to publish on your own site (optionally syndicate 
  > elsewhere), and own your data.

Technology-wise, this website is well on its way to being a full IndieWeb 
citizen. The only thing missing is automated sending of [[Webmentions]].
